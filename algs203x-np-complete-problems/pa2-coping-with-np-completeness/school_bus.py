# python3
# Input: An integer (vert) for vertices
#        An integer (edge) for edges
#        Next lines (edges) are the vertices that are connected and the time it takes to traverse
# Output: The minimum time to go through a route that visits all vertices exactly once (with exception to the first vertex)
#         The order in which the vertices are visited (don't output the starting vertex at the end)
